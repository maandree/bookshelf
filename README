Type `bookshelf` followed by a `grep` expression inside  the directory
with to book you are looking for. Then type the index of the correct
book and it will be opened.

This is very useful if you want do not know the exact name of the book
or looking for an author, or if the filename starts with the author,
but you do know now how that is; and you have a lot of books in some
categories.

By default xpdf used for opening the document, if $TERM=linux, then
jfbview is used. If you want another viewer, export that command to
PDFVIEWER.
