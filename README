Type `bookshelf` followed by a `grep` expression in the directory with
to book you are looking with. Then type the index of the correcty book
and it will be opened.

This is very useful if you want do not know the exact name of the book
or looking for an author, or if the filename starts with the author,
but you do know now how that is; and you have a lot of books in some
categories.
